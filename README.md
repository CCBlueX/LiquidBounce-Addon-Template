# LiquidBounce Add-on Template

A starting point for a [LiquidBounce](https://github.com/CCBlueX/LiquidBounce) add-on.

## How an add-on is loaded

Your class is named under the `liquidbounce` entrypoint, so Fabric resolves it before the client
starts. `AddonManager` then calls your hooks in a fixed order:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    jar["mods/your-addon.jar"] --> discover

    subgraph startup ["LiquidBounce startup"]
        direction TB
        discover["AddonManager.discover()"]
        regcat["registerCategories()"]
        init["initializeAddons()"]
        loadAll["ConfigSystem.loadAll()"]
        notify["notifyConfigsLoaded()"]
        shutdown["AddonManager.shutdown()"]
        storeAll["ConfigSystem.storeAll()"]
    end

    discover --> regcat --> init --> loadAll --> notify
    notify --> running(["game running"])
    running --> shutdown --> storeAll

    regcat -. your code .-> h1["onRegisterCategories()<br/>registerCategory(...)"]
    init -. your code .-> h2["onInitialize()<br/>registerModules / registerCommand / config"]
    notify -. your code .-> h3["onConfigsLoaded()<br/>settings are restored"]
    shutdown -. your code .-> h4["onShutdown()<br/>flush state"]
```

Two consequences worth knowing:

- Categories are registered before any add-on's `onInitialize`, because constructing a
  `ClientModule` needs its category to already exist.
- Everything you register in `onInitialize` happens **before** `ConfigSystem.loadAll()`. Register
  later than that and your settings will not be restored from disk.

If a hook throws, the add-on is marked `ERRORED`, everything it registered is withdrawn, and the
client carries on starting. `-Dliquidbounce.disableAddons=<id>` skips one outright.

## Requirements

- JDK 25
- A LiquidBounce build to compile against (a published snapshot, or one you built yourself)

## Getting started

1. Click **Use this template** on GitHub, or `git clone --depth 1` this repository.
2. Rename things away from the example. There are eight places:

   | File | What to change |
   |---|---|
   | `settings.gradle.kts` | `rootProject.name` |
   | `gradle.properties` | `maven_group`, `archives_base_name` |
   | `src/main/resources/fabric.mod.json` | `id`, `name`, `description`, `authors`, the entrypoint class |
   | `src/main/resources/example-addon.mixins.json` | filename, and the `package` |
   | `src/main/resources/example-addon.accesswidener` | filename (and `loom.accessWidenerPath` in `build.gradle.kts`) |
   | `src/main/resources/resources/example-addon/lang/` | folder name, which must match your add-on id |
   | `src/main/resources/assets/example-addon/` | folder name, and the `icon` path |
   | `src/main/kotlin/com/example/addon/` | package name |

3. `./gradlew build`, then drop `build/libs/<your-addon>.jar` into your `mods/` folder next to
   LiquidBounce.
4. In game, `.addon list` should show it, and `.example` should answer.

## Targeting a LiquidBounce version

`gradle/libs.versions.toml`:

```toml
liquidbounce = "0.40.1+26.2-SNAPSHOT"
```

- `<version>+<mc>` for a release, from `maven.ccbluex.net/releases`
- `<version>+<mc>-SNAPSHOT` for the moving nextgen build, from `maven.ccbluex.net/snapshots`
- `<version>+<mc>-<sha>-SNAPSHOT` to pin one commit

To build against a local client, run `./gradlew publishToMavenLocal` in a LiquidBounce checkout;
`mavenLocal()` is already in this template's repositories.

**Do not add a `mappings(...)` line.** LiquidBounce declares none either, and Loom defaults to
Mojang official mappings for this Minecraft version. A different mapping set produces an add-on that
compiles and then fails on every Minecraft call.

## What the example covers

- `ExampleAddon`, the entrypoint and its lifecycle hooks
- `ExampleCategories`, a custom ClickGUI category
- `modules/ModuleExample`, a `ClientModule` with settings and a tick handler
- `commands/CommandExample`, a Brigadier command
- `mixin/MixinExampleTitleScreen`, a Mixin into a vanilla class
- `resources/example-addon/lang/en_us.json`, translations merged into the client's language files

Client translation keys always win on collision, so an add-on cannot redefine a built-in string.
